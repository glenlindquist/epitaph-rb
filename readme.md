# Epitaph [WIP]

Ruby/Sinatra port of [Max Kreminski's Epitaph](https://github.com/mkremins/epitaph).
The original game was written in ClojureScriptâ€”it has a lot more interesting things going on w/r/t generating words and language.

This version is a fairly naive adapation. 

Still a work-in-progress that does not yet have all of the specific event text correctly set.
(You'll notice every negative event ends with a giant rock destroying the planet :) ).

Event probabilities need to be tweaked for balance.

Made with Sinatra and React.
